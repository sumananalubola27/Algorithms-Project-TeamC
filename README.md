## Input
We give distance matrix and weather data as the input for the code

## Output
we get the visualization map between all the cities which includes the distance and weather

Steps
- Extract all the files in the project.
- After creating the project, add code to the main.java file and rename the file as CityGraph1.java
-	To include the library files follow this path
    file>project sturucture>modules>dependencies>libraries
-	Update the paths of the weather data and distance matrix in your computer
-	Run CityGraph1.java
-	We get the visualization map as the output.

## Example
- In file CityGraph1.java, to include library files
